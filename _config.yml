# Extension of the internal default list of files and/or directories to be

# to the 'source' (repository root) directory.
#
# NOTE: An excluded item may be explicitly processed by listing the
# corresponding path in the list defined by the `include` key.
# WARNING: Dot-prefixed files and directories are excluded by default.
