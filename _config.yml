# Exclude
# Extension of the internal default list of files and/or directories to be
# excluded from processing.  Entries in this list will not end up in the
# 'destination' ('_site') directory.  Path exclusions are performed relative
# to the 'source' (repository root) directory.
#
# NOTE: An excluded item may be explicitly processed by listing the
# corresponding path in the list defined by the `include` key.
# WARNING: Dot-prefixed files and directories are excluded by default.
